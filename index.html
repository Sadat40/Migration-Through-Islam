            <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>I grew up quite religious, but I was always lazy; I believed in Islam and its ideals, but I also wanted to be able to live a normal life, assimilating with my friends. My friends were never religious, so I never felt like I needed to be religious. My cousins weren’t even religious.
            </p>
            <p>But my father had always put emphasis on religion, telling me that he doesn’t care what I accomplish; the only way he would be proud of me is if I stayed close to my religion. So I always tried to, hoping to please him.</p>
            <p>But when the global pandemic came upon our lives, I started looking to my faith as support, having faith that if I prayed more and recited the Quran more, my creator would save us when everyone in my house was diagnosed with Covid 19. We all survived, and my increased level of faith just stuck with me.</p>
            <p>Now I am president of my school’s Muslim Students Association, trying my best to serve as a mentor to my community. I’m not close to my faith to please my father; it’s to please my creator. In fact, I’d say I know more about my religion than my father. </p>

                    <p>Prayer (salat) is one of the five pillars of Islam, the core beliefs that serve as the foundation for this Abrahamic religion. Nadia doesn’t pray, so right off the bat, we see that she isn’t too religious.
                    </p>
                    <p>    She is disobeying direct commands written in the Quran. As Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "The Muslims unanimously agree that the one who denies that prayer is obligatory is a kaafir," a disbeliever.
                    </p>
                    <p> Even if she is a “kaafir,” she still wears the hijab, a symbol of Islam that serves to protect a woman from “evil eyes.”

                <p>They were sitting at a table for two by a window, overlooking snarled traffic on the street below. Their phones rested screens-down between them, like the weapons of desperadoes at a parley.</p>
                <p>She smiled. Took a sip. And spoke, the lower half of her face obscured by her cup.</p>
                <p>“So men don’t fuck with me,” she said (Hamid 14).</p>

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>Women in Islam cover themselves and don’t speak to men without the presence of their fathers. This ideology gives men the impression that these women are “off limits.” How can you get with someone who won’t speak to you? Nadia uses this to keep men away, giving the impression that she is “off limits.”</p>

                <p>Nadia looked him in the eye. “You don’t say your evening prayers?” she asked.</p>
                <p>Saeed conjured up his most endearing grin. “Not always. Sadly.”</p>
                <p>Her expression did not change (Hamid 8).</p>

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>We start to see the weight of consciousness in Saeed’s heart. While Nadia’s expression does not change because she doesn’t see the significance of missing prayer, Saeed’s expression changes to an “endearing grin,” as he even says that not praying is “sad.” This may even be guilt, guilt that he doesn’t keep up with his daily prayers, and this foreshadows the middle and end of the book as he only grows more religious.</p>

                <p>[Nadia] asked Saeed if he would like a joint, to which he fortunately said yes, and which he offered to roll (Hamid 19). </p>

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>We can once again see here that Saeed doesn’t start off as too religious; he has most likely smoked before this as well, having the ability to “roll.” But, why does Hamid say “fortunately?” Prior to this sentence, there isn’t any reasoning to support why Hamid would attach this throwaway intensifier to the sentence. It is most likely to show that smoking is out of character for Saeed, something even the narrator would be surprised about. Since Hamid says Saeed “fortunately” says yes, he implies that there is shock and there is shock because it isn’t typical for Saeed, most likely due to religion. Otherwise, why would there be any reason to <em>unfortunately</em> say no?</p>

                <p>She asked if he had brought a condom and he held her face in his hands and said, “I don’t think we should have sex until we’re married.” </p>
                <p>And she laughed and pressed close.</p>
                <p>And he shook his head.</p>
                <p>And she stopped and stared at him and said, “Are you fucking joking?” (Hamid 33).</p>

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>Nadia tries to have sex with Saeed, and she doesn’t think it will be a point of concern. Rather than asking him if he would want to have sex, she presumes that he does, instead asking if he has a condom. For two Muslims to be having sex, one would expect that the two have a conversation about whether or not they would actually have intercourse, but Nadia skips over this. To be fair, the two were in a relationship, and in a normal relationship, you’d expect sex, many times on the first date. In Nadia’s head, her relationship with Saeed is “normal.” She doesn't think of it as two Muslims getting together—she thinks of it as two ordinary people coming together and experiencing romance. On the other hand, Saeed looks at this relationship with the Muslim mindset that his parents have instilled in him; he hopes to wait till marriage. For the first time in the novel, we see some direct resistance from Saeed, trying to get closer to his religion rather than simply feeling guilty of straying away. </p>
                    <p>And he is able to stay true to that for longer: “THEY SMOKED A JOINT and listened to music and after a while Nadia tried again to make Saeed have sex with her…and Saeed succeeded again in holding back, even as they pleasured each other, and he told her again that they should not have sex before they were married, that doing otherwise was against his beliefs” (Hamid 37).</p>

                    His mother was no more, and his father seemed not to concern himself with these romantic matters, and so they proceeded in secret (Hamid 48).

                    <p>Towards the beginning, Nadia and Saeed have a secret relationship as Saeed doesn’t want to bring a girl over to this conservative household, but as time passes and Nadia moves in with Saeed, we see Saeed’s dad being a lot looser. But should he? 
                    </p>
                    <p>In Islam, a father’s duty is to guide his children to Islam and enforce that they practice the religion. Allowing his son’s girlfriend to stay with his family goes against the religion, but his wife recently passed, and so we see him become less like a father who would be “offended.”  </p>
                    <p>As readers, we witness a change; we see Saeed’s father “migrate” from being perceived as a father who wouldn’t let his son bring a girl over and be “offended” to a father who lets his son’s girlfriend stay in his house.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even at the end, when Saeed and Nadia run away, his father lets the two go together, despite rules of men and women not being allowed to be alone in a romantic sense, even convincing Nadia to not leave Saeed’s side</p>

                    [Saeed] was drawn to people from their country, both in the labor camp and online. It seemed to Nadia that the farther they moved from the city of their birth, through space and through time, the more he sought to strengthen his connection to it, tying ropes to the air of an era that for her was unambiguously gone (Hamid 99).

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>As Saeed and Nadia enter this new land, they grow apart. Now that he has lost both of his parents, Saeed starts praying a lot more; like his father, he is also migrating through his religion, but in the opposite direction. He is getting closer to his faith. As it states in the text, “He had two or three white hairs in the stubble of his beard now, new arrivals this summer, and he prayed more regularly, every morning and evening, and perhaps on his lunch breaks too” (98).
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, while Nadia is already distant from her faith, leaving her country pushes her further. The era of any religious sentiment is “unambiguously gone,” as she leaves the theocracy in the past, leaving her already little faith behind.

                    To Saeed, Nadia looked much the same as she did when they first met, which is to say strikingly fetching, if vastly more tired. But it was inexplicable that she continued to wear her black robes, and it grated on him a bit, for she did not pray, and she avoided speaking their language, and she avoided their people, and sometimes he wanted to shout, well take it off then, and then he would wince inwardly, since he believed he loved her, and his resentment, when it bubbled up like this, made him angry with himself, with the man he seemed to be becoming, a less than romantic man, which was not the sort of man he believed a man should aspire to be (Hamid 99).

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>The two grow to be quite different—the spark that was once there faded and the reason behind it is that their personalities grow further and further apart. He tries getting closer to his faith, and his resentment at Nadia wearing a hijab, which never bothered him before, represents the loss of connection he feels with her. And that’s the “less than romantic man” he is becoming: a man who doesn't feel love for his partner anymore because of how different she is from him and how similar she is to when he first meets her. He has changed a lot since they moved and in his eyes, she is the same.

                    ONE NIGHT Nadia brought back some weed a coworker had given her. She did not know how Saeed would react, and this fact struck her as she hiked home. In the city of their birth they had smoked joints together with pleasure, but a year had passed since then, and he had changed since then  (Hamid 102).

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>The “change” she talks about is that he grew closer to his faith, faith that prohibits consuming drugs. She has not changed since they moved from the “city of their birth,” but she sees that he has.

                    Saeed rolled the joint for them both, Nadia barely containing her jubilation, and wanting to hug him but restraining herself. He lit it and they consumed it (Hamid 103).

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>This confuses me and it shocks Nadia, filling her with “jubilation.” This entire time I thought he was getting closer to his religion, praying more often and connecting with more Muslims. So this quote raises the question: is he actually becoming more religious or is he straying further away like Nadia?

                    Now, though, in Marin, Saeed prayed even more, several times a day, and he prayed fundamentally as a gesture of love for what had gone and would go and could be loved in no other way. When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched (Hamid 106).
                    </p>

                <div class="popup">
                    <p>This captures and concludes the migration within religion that is present in this story. In the beginning of the novel, Saeed considers himself Muslim, feels bad about neglecting prayer, and works to keep his virginity until marriage.</p>
                    <p>Of course we see him smoke and do everything short of sex, meaning that he commits a lot of sin, but we can see that he still has some degree of good intention in a Muslim perspective.</p>
                    <p>As he starts praying more and connecting with other Muslims, readers get the impression that he is becoming more religious, getting closer to his faith, but then he smokes weed. So what’s his deal?
                    </p>
                    <p>The migration that Saeed truly feels here is going from praying “out of curiosity” (Hamid 105) as a child to neglecting prayer as he grows up to using prayer as a way to get closer to his parents.</p>
                    <p>Prayer is used to get closer to the creator, Allah SWT, so as Saeed uses prayer to get closer to his parents, we can draw a distinction: he isn’t getting closer to his faith, but rather trying to get closer to the family that he lost. His migration does not show that he is becoming more conservatively "religious," but rather that he starts using prayer in a <em>different</em> way. </p>

                    <p><a href="https://library.louisville.edu/ali/islam#:~:text=Ali%20discovers%20the%20Nation%20of%20Islam,-1959&text=A%20central%20goal%20of%20the,for%20all%20of%20my%20life.%22">Muhammad Ali</a> was celebrated as the most famous “Champion of Freedom.” At a 1959 Golden Gloves boxing tournament, Ali first learned of the Nation of Islam, finding it interesting due to its mission to empower African Americans by describing them as “Black Muslims.”</p>

                    <p>Ali saw Christianity as a religion of oppression, as Christian white slave owners abused black slaves, and a cartoon showing this led Ali to feel like he needed to do something.</p>

                    <p>In 1964, he publicly announced his conversion to Islam due to his beliefs in the Nation of Islam empowering African Americans and Christianity oppressing them.</p>

                    <p>He changed his name from Cassius Clay, given to him by his white slave master, to Muhammad Ali, and he moved closer to the Nation of Islam’s Mosque Maryam, to be close to the mosque at all times.</p>

                <img src= "dawah.png">

                    <p>A Turkish-Kurdish YouTuber from the UK, Ali Dawah converted to Islam in 2012. In his early life, he used to be part of gangs, growing an obsession with guns. Although he hadn’t done drugs, he was constantly surrounded by them as well as people who did them. </p>

                    <p>When he converted to Islam, his father didn’t approve, so he had to run away while his father tried chasing him. Meanwhile, he lived with a friend for a little bit, and began studying the Quran. </p>

                    <p>In 2013, he launched a YouTube channel to answer misconceptions about Islam and create inspiring content centered around Islam for everyone to benefit from. Now, he has over 1 million subscribers! </p>

                    <p>Going from a life of gang violence to a life of spreading Islamic teachings on a large, global scale with hiding and running in between, Ali Dawah migrated through Islam, having a unique journey.  </p>

                <h1>Adam Saleh</h1>
                <img src="adam.png">

                    <p>Gaining prominence as one of the few mainstream Muslim YouTubers in America, Adam Saleh has arguably had a migration through Islam, but different from the rest. Capitalizing on a mostly Muslim audience, Saleh made content that appealed to them such as “7 Mind Blowing Miracles of Allah” and pranks during Ramadan. </p>

                    <p>But as he grew as a content creator, his actions strayed from those of practicing Muslims. He started creating music and explicit music videos to complement this. In his debut song on his second album, he had a music video where he had relations with a girl, who in one scene licked him.</p>

                    <p>He also posted content of him kissing other girls and others wrongfully exposed his sins by posting videos of him in the club. He also opened up about making a living as a camboy before making YouTube videos, a surprise to his many Muslim fans.</p>

                    <p>His manager also revealed that he fixed his boxing fights and allegedly sexually assaulted a waitress. Though he started off as a symbol of pride for Muslim Americans, recently he has received little praise as he no longer can act as the inspiration he once was. He still publicly identifies as Muslim, never speaking out against the religion, but in the public’s eyes, his image has migrated from an image that served as an example to an image that is every Muslim parents’ worst nightmare. </p>

However, he joined the Muslim Students Association (MSA) and participated in the Muslim Interscholastic Tournament  (MIST), which got him closer to his faith due to the bonds he created. </p>

                <p>Namera was raised as a Muslim although she didn’t follow all of the rules regularly. Still, she believed in Allah and accepted the religion. However, after a heartbreak, her outlook on the religion changed as her ex-boyfriend was religious and after he broke her heart, the principles she picked up from him guided her to feel better.</p>

                <p>Yes, indeed I was raised as a Muslim, but my parents weren’t too religious. I prayed one prayer a day with my family, I always ate Zabiha halal meat, and I had Arabic classes.</p>

                <p>Hardship brought me closer to Islam. When I went through difficult times, I turned to religion more because it made me more appreciative of what I have and who I am. These hardships brought me even closer to Islam. </p>

                <p>Sharika was raised to be quite religious, regularly praying and reciting the Quran. However, when she entered high school and primarily befriended non-Muslims, she found herself in an environment where religion wasn’t too significant, causing her to stray from the religion. </p>

                <p>Ihsaan was raised with strong Islamic values, regularly going to the mosque and studying hadiths, or words in the Quran. However, the crowds he surrounded himself with weren’t filled with people who were raised the same way. Therefore, in efforts to assimilate, he strayed further from his religion. </p>

                <p class = "question"><strong>Were you raised as a Muslim? Are your parents Muslim? What are some things you grew up doing related to Islam?</strong></p>
                
                <p>Yes, I was raised as a Muslim because my parents were religious. My dad took me to the mosque for daily prayers and my mom hired an Islamic teacher to teach me how to read the Quran. My mom and sisters wear hijabs. They always shared Islamic hadiths with me as well.</p>

                <p>Mohammad was raised as a Muslim but throughout most of his life, Islam was just something he followed because his parents made him. When he dealt with death for the first time, however, he found that religion was very helpful, helping his emotional wellbeing. </p>

                <p class = "question"><strong>Were you raised as a Muslim? Are your parents Muslim? What are some things you grew up doing related to Islam?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, I was, and my parents are very religious and enforced the ideals in me. I prayed, fasted, and I ate halal meat. I celebrated Eid and did Eid prayers.</p>

                <p>We can see that what brings people closer to Islam is that it serves as a guiding force in life. Islam is a religion that preaches good morals and the words of the Quran serve as a beacon of guidance and hope that everything will be okay because everything that happens is part of Allah’s plan.</p>

                <p>Lil Durk and Ali Dawah found clarity in Islam; it helped them make sense of the world. They had so many questions and in their hearts, Islam answered them.</p>
                
                <p>Mohammad Ali (not the boxer) and Saeed got closer to the religion due to death. However, there is a big difference between their journeys. Mohammad Ali feared the afterlife, so he got closer to his faith so that his faith could protect him. On the other hand, Saeed used prayer to get closer to his dead parents, not his spiritual journey.</p>
                
                <p>It is also important to note what strays people from Islam. Nadia wanted to embrace change, and she already wasn’t religious, but when she left her theocratic state, she wanted to leave the religion behind entirely. Just like Sharika and Ihsaan found crowds that weren’t religious and thus pushing them away from the religion, Nadia reached a new state where religion wasn’t as important as it was before, so she hoped to embrace that change. Her miration was more physical than emotional, but still it is important to mention that there still was a change. Due to the physical change in her environment, she hoped to embrace an emotional change in her lifestyle.</p>
                <p>With that being said, that's a wrap to our discussion of migration through Islam. Thank you for reading. Please give me a good grade.</p>
